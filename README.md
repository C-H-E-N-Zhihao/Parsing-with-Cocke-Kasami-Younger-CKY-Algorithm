# Parsing-with-Cocke-Kasami-Younger-CKY-Algorithm

## Project Overview
This project implements the **Cocke-Kasami-Younger (CKY) algorithm**, a fundamental parsing algorithm used in computational linguistics and formal language theory. The CKY algorithm determines whether a given string can be generated by a **context-free grammar (CFG)** in **Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)**. Additionally, an **extension to the Probabilistic CKY (PCKY) algorithm** is implemented, which computes the probability of different parse trees.

## Features
- **Implementation of the CKY algorithm** for syntactic analysis of strings.
- **Transformation of any CFG to CNF**, allowing the use of CKY on arbitrary grammars.
- **Handling of the empty string (Ïµ)** in grammar transformations.
- **Implementation of the Probabilistic CKY (PCKY) algorithm**, which assigns probabilities to different parses.
- **Dictionary-based grammar representation** for efficient rule lookup.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd cky-algorithm
   ```
2. Install dependencies (if required):
   ```sh
   pip install numpy
   ```

## Usage
Run the main script to test the CKY algorithm:
```sh
python main.py
```
This script will:
- Load the grammar.
- Convert it to Chomsky Normal Form (if needed).
- Parse input strings using CKY or PCKY.

## Files Included
- `main.py` â€“ The main program that runs the CKY algorithm.
- `cky_fnc_pcky.py` â€“ Contains implementations of CKY, CFG-to-CNF transformation, and PCKY.
- `test_cases/` â€“ A folder containing test grammars and input strings.
- `PAA_PrÃ ctica.pdf` â€“ The project report detailing the implementation.

## Grammar Representation
Grammars are stored as **Python dictionaries**, where:
- Keys are **non-terminal symbols**.
- Values are lists of possible **productions**.

Example:
```python
{
    "S": [("NP", "VP"), ("VP",)],
    "NP": [("Det", "N")],
    "VP": [("V", "NP"), ("V",)],
    "Det": ["the", "a"],
    "N": ["cat", "dog"],
    "V": ["chased", "saw"]
}
```

## Algorithm Explanation
### 1. **CKY Algorithm**
The CKY algorithm operates as follows:
- Constructs a **parsing table** using dynamic programming.
- Fills in the table bottom-up, checking which non-terminals can generate substrings.
- If the start symbol `S` appears in the final cell, the string is **accepted**.

### 2. **CFG to CNF Conversion**
To use CKY, grammars must be in **Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)**. The conversion involves:
- Removing **empty rules** (Ïµ-productions).
- Eliminating **unit productions** (rules of the form `A â†’ B`).
- Converting long right-hand sides into **binary rules** (`A â†’ BC`).

### 3. **Probabilistic CKY (PCKY)**
- Extends CKY to **probabilistic grammars**.
- Stores probabilities of different parse trees.
- Uses **dynamic programming** to keep track of the most probable parse.

## Future Improvements
- Implement a **user interface** for interactive parsing.
- Optimize performance for large grammars.
- Extend PCKY to generate **parse trees**.
